# Introduction to Data Analysis

## Learning Objectives

路       Understanding the role and responsibilities of a data analyst.

路       Exploring the data analysis process and its applications.

路       Introduction to key tools and technologies used in data analysis.

路       Understand how to interpret data, identify trends, and draw meaningful insights from it.

&#x20;What is data analysis?

Data analysis is the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights and make informed decisions.

What is Data?

Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts, figures, observations, or measurements collected from various sources. It can take various forms, such as numbers, text, images, audio, video, or any other format that can be recorded and stored for analysis or interpretation.

What are the types of Data?

* Quantitative Data: Numerical data with measurable values.
* Qualitative Data: Non-numerical data describing qualities or attributes.
* Time Series Data: Data collected over time to observe trends.

What does the Data Analysis Process involve?

* Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from various sources.
* Data Cleaning: Removing errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies from data.
* Data Exploration: Visualizing and summarizing data to identify patterns.
* Data Analysis: Applying statistical and machine learning techniques for insights.
* Interpretation: Drawing meaningful conclusions from analysis results.

What are the Questions to Ask in Data Analysis?

* Define the objective of the analysis(i.e. Problem Statement)?
* What data is available and relevant?
* What methods and tools will be used for analysis?
* What are the potential limitations or biases in the data?

What are the Tools for Data Analysis?

* Excel: Basic data analysis and visualization.
* SQL: Data querying and manipulation.
* Python/R: Advanced statistical and machine learning analysis.
* Tableau/Power BI: Interactive data visualization.

Identifying Trends in Data Analysis

* Visualization: Creating charts and graphs to identify patterns.
* Time Series Analysis: Analyzing data over time to observe trends.
* Regression Analysis: Identifying relationships between variables.

Principles of a Good Data Analysis

1. Present Data Clearly and Transparently
   * Avoid manipulation.
   * Ensure data is presented honestly.
2. Use Measures Linked to Desired Outcomes
   * Drive informed actions.
   * Align with priorities.
3. Showcase Effectiveness of Business Processes
   * Present data on outcomes.
   * Demonstrate impact.
4. Utilize Data for Continuous Improvement
   * Drive improvements based on data insights.
   * Foster a culture of learning and growth.
5. Clearly Outline Analysis and Decision-Making
   * Lay out the process for clarity.
   * Enhance transparency and accountability.
6. Consider a Broad Range of Evidence
   * Data provides guidance but not the full picture.
   * Supplement with other sources for comprehensive insights.
7.  Leverage Experience of Involved Individuals

    * Tap into the knowledge of process participants.
    * Enhance understanding of performance issues.
